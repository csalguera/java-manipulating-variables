## Java Manipulating Variables

## Guessing Game

```
public class GuessingGame {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int mystery1 = 8 + 6;
    int mystery2 = 8 - 6;
	}
}
```

In the file GuessingGame.java, we have defined two integers mystery1 and mystery2.

We will talk about these operators, among others, in the rest of the lesson.

Use System.out.println() to print the variable that holds a value of 2.

## PlusAndMinus

```
public class PlusAndMinus {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int zebrazInZoo = 8;
    int giraffesInZoo = 4;
  }
}
```

Create an int variable called animalsInZoo that holds the amount of zebras plus the amount of giraffes at the zoo.

Then, print your animalsInZoo variable.

Two of the zebras have been traded to a neighboring rival zoo. Subtract 2 from the number of zebras and store the result in a variable called numZebrasAfterTrade.

Then, print the numZebrasAfterTrade variable!
