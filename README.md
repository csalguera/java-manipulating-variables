## Java Manipulating Variables

## Guessing Game

```
public class GuessingGame {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int mystery1 = 8 + 6;
    int mystery2 = 8 - 6;
	}
}
```

In the file GuessingGame.java, we have defined two integers mystery1 and mystery2.

We will talk about these operators, among others, in the rest of the lesson.

Use System.out.println() to print the variable that holds a value of 2.
